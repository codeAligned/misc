\begin{abstract}
\AlgName\ is a sentiment tagging algorithm designed to determine the sentiment of individual tweets.  The algorithm uses both SVM and tagged twitter data to decide whether or not a given tweet has a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Our algorithm performed fairly well compared to other, non-SVM based versions of our algorithm.
