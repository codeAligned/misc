\section{Conclusion}
Our final \AlgName\ algorithm is a LinearSVC unigram model that uses binary feature counting and is trained on the SemEval training data and 5000 negative-tagged tweets from the Sentiment140 lexicon. This algorithm provides a viable way to identify tweets with positive and neutral sentiment, and offers modest recognition of negative tweets. Moving forward, we are convinced of a need to find new ways to detect negative sentiment, whether that be syntactic or semantic analysis, that can go beyond the methods described in this paper.
